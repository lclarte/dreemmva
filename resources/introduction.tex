\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Presentation}The goal of this project is the prediction of a subject's gender from its brain rhythms.
The dataset provided by Dreem for this project is divided into a \textit{training set} and a \textit{test set}. The training set and the test set both contains EEG measurement for 946 subjects. On each of these subjects, the EEG signal has been recorded on 7 channels on 40 time intervals of 2 seconds. The sampling frequency of the signal is 250 Hz. As a consequence, each subject is associated with an input array of size $(40, 7, 500)$. The recordings were made during the night.   

\paragraph{Previous work}

The challenge webpage was presented with a reference article \cite{nature_original}. In this work, the author applied a deep-learning model to the prediction of the gender from EEG recordings. Using a convolutional neural network, they achieved 81\% of accuracy.
